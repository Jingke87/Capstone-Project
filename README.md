# Can money buy health? – The relationship between health and wealth level of the US residents

1. Introduction

1.1 Description of the Issue

As the old quote says, “Money cannot buy health.”, and we all know the meaning of this quote. In reality, on the other hand, the relationship between the income level and the health/longevity of a population is becoming more noticeable than ever before. In this study, we will examine the correlation between income and health in the US circumstances, using each state as research individuals.

1.2 Description of the Data

In this study we will collect 4 sets of data:

-	The GDP per capita by state in the past 5 years
-	The medium household income by state in the past 5 years
-	The most recent obesity rates of adults by state
-	The most recent average life expectancy by state

We will use a variety of data science libraries in Python to examine the relationship between the data sets and visualize the results. We will also use the geographic data retrieved on https://foursquare.com to complete the data visualization process.
